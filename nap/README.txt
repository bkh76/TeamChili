PACKAGES

parser:   Java classes generated by ANTLR
ast: 	  AST classes
type:	  Classes to represent NAP types
util:	  Some utility classes (e.g. Pair)
compiler: Main reads the file given in argument,
          builds the symbol table, if there are
	  errors (such as undeclared variables,
	  or already declared variables), the
	  errors are printed. If the program is
	  error-free (at least this kind of errors),
	  it is then pretty-printed.
