The naming convention was:

- Exp + something for expression related classes, this includes array
  access and array enumeration, call to conversion functions, function
  calls, application of a unary operation: all these classes should
  be renamed. 

- Stm + something for instructions, this includes loops, these classes
  should be renamed.

Array enumeration corresponds to the right hand side of something
like:

var array<int> table = { 1, 1+1, 3, 2*2 }

This list of expressions cannot be implemeted as a Java enumeration.
